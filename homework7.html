    <h1>Stay</h1>
    <h2>Justin Bieber,The Kid Laroi</h2>
    <p>[Chorus: The Kid LAROI] <br>
    <em>I do the same thing I told you that I never would <br>
    I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could <br>
    I know that I can’t find nobody else as good as you <br>
    I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey (Oh) <br></em>
    <br>
    [Verse 1: The Kid LAROI] <br>
    I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still <br>
    I realize the time that I wasted here <br>
    I feel like you can't feel the way I feel <br>
    Oh, I’ll be fucked up if you can't be right here <br>
    <br>
    [Pre-Chorus: The Kid LAROI] <br>
    Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah) <br>
    Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah) <br>
    Oh, ooh-woah (Oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah) <br>
    Oh, I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here <br>
    <br>
    [Chorus: The Kid LAROI] <br>
    <em>I do the same thing I told you that I never would <br>
    I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could <br>
    I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you <br>
    I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey <br>
    I do the same thing I told you that I never would <br>
    I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could <br>
    I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you <br>
    I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey</p></em>
